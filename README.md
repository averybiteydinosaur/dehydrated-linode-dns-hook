This is a hook script written in rust used for dns challenge verification of certificates with linode, as per: https://github.com/dehydrated-io/dehydrated/blob/master/docs/dns-verification.md

Assuming you have rust installed you will need to clone the repo and create a folder `.cargo` with the file `config.toml` inside it. In this file add an environment variable with your API key (get it here: https://www.linode.com/docs/products/tools/api/get-started/#get-an-access-token). 

for example:
```
[env]
API_KEY = "64characterAPIkeygoeshere"
```

As each dns challenge will take at least a few minutes it is HIGHLY recommended to set `HOOKCHAIN=yes` (see https://github.com/dehydrated-io/dehydrated/blob/master/docs/hook_chain.md) inside your dehydrated config, otherwise you're in for a long wait if you've a lot of domains to certify.
